Users will be challenged by having to go through a series of questions about events and 
characters from Marvel movies. Each question will be accompanied by four buttons with different 
answers to choose from. The user will have to make sure to pick the correct answer in order to

The game has interactive elements such as buttons that change colors or appear after certain actions.

## Features

* The main body color is red, which is especially prominent at the top of the web page.
* The bright red attracts the user's attention, and makes the bold white text pop to catch the eye.

## Testing 

* The webpage and its functionalities were tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
* The buttons, styling and interactive elements were functioning optimally in both browsers with no issue.
* There were no media queries used in the code for this webpage, yet after testing the it the page is perfectly responsive and fits well into the smallest viewport.

* This was most likely a result of using flex boxes in the HTML and CSS programs.
* Before deploying the site there was a bug that caused the question and answers sections to disappear after adding some JavaScript.
* I was able to find the missing code through an online tutorial that I found.

## Validator Testing 

* ### HTML
* The HTML validator approved the code and showed no errors to report.

## Credit

* ### Content
* For the layout of the page and design I planned to make it simple and bold.
* I already had a blueprint drawn on paper, but I also took some ideas from this online [Quiz](https://heywise.com/quiz/only-the-biggest-dragon-ball-z-fans-will-ace-this-quiz/21/).
* I originally wanted to have the questions in two parallel columns, then decided against it.
* Since some answers will be longer than others, it may be more aesthetically pleasing to have them vertically centered, so I made them one column.
* Thanks to this plan the HTML was quickly put together, for the CSS code I used a few resources to help me navigate it.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) was the pillar of support, and helped regain my confidence with CSS when it was needed.
* As I was planning to use flex boxes throughout the project, I also used the Flexbox [Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) game.
* This website helped me organize the page with a few simple commands thanks to the flex boxes.
* For JaVaScript I needed more help and I was able to find good resources in the form of YouTube tutorials.
* I initially watched short quick tutorials in hopes of finding the most simplified explanations, much like in this [Video](https://youtu.be/lkIFF4maKMU).
* I then watched longer tutorials for a deeper understanding, and the channel "Programming with [Mosh"](https://youtu.be/W6NZfCO5SIk) was very helpful.
* In the end the best resource I found was this tutorial by [GreatStack](https://youtu.be/PBcqGxrr9g8).
* Most of the JAvaScrip in my project was borrowed from GreatStack's in-depth YouTube tutorial.
* The video also points out how each line of code affects the webpage once it's deployed, and shows the page each step of the way.
* It was also advantageous for me as my design was simple and resembled the example used in the video.
* These resources were also supplemented by W3 Schools, which aided in further simplifying difficult concepts.


### Media

* No photos were used in this website which is a big disadvantage when it comes to engaging the user in an online game.
* This point is emphasized by the fact that the imagery and relevance of comic book and superheros currently in pop-culture.
* The best media resource utilized in this quiz game is the font, as it anchors the theme and conveys energy and excitement to the users.
